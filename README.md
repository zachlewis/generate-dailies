# OpenImageIO / FFMPEG Daily

## Overview
Daily is a tool to convert scene-linear openexr images into display-referred quicktime movies. It supports uint16 precision and uses OpenColorIO for colorspace conversions. Common dailies movie features like text comments, frame number overlays, slate frames, and shot number overlays are supported. It also supports resize operations, including cropping, scaling, padding, and masking.

Daily uses OpenImageIO >= 2.0 and OpenColorIO for reading exr, and ffmpeg for encoding to quicktime. No temporary files are required.

Daily reads configuration data from a yaml file, and has the ability to create many custom "codec" presets for different output formats. For example, one could have an internal dailies review format that is 2560x1440 10 bit 4:4:4 h264 log, and a deliveries format that is 1920x1080 8 bit 4:2:2 DNxHD.

## Commandline Options

```
usage: daily [-h] [-c CODEC] [-p PROFILE] [-o OUTPUT] [-ot OVERLAYTEXT]
             [-st SLATETEXT] [--ocio OCIO] [-d]
             inputPath

Process given image sequence with ocio display, resize and output to ffmpeg
for encoding into a dailies movie.

positional arguments:
  inputPath             Input exr image sequence. Can be a folder containing
                        images, a path to the first image, a percent 05d
                        path, or a ##### path.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CODEC, --codec CODEC
                        Codec names defined in dailies-config.yaml: "avchq",
                        "avclq", "avc_lq", "avcth", "hevc_hq", "hevc_lq",
                        "hevc", "prores_4444", "prores_422hq", "prores_422",
                        "dnxhd_36", "dnxhd_175", "dnxhr_hqx", "mjpeg",
                        default is "avchq"
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        Dailies overlay profiles defined in dailie-
                        config.yaml: "internal", "delivery". Default is
                        "delivery"
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output directory: Optional override to movie_location
                        in the DAILIES_CONFIG. This can be a path relative to
                        the image sequence.
  -ot OVERLAYTEXT, --overlayText OVERLAYTEXT
                        Text elements and contents overlay on frames: e.g.
                        "artist= Jed Smith : comment= this is stupid man:
                        framecounter : sequence
  -st SLATETEXT, --slateText SLATETEXT
                        Text elements and contents for slate: e.g.
                        "artist=Jed Smith : comment= this is stupid man
  --ocio OCIO           OCIO color space presets defined in dailie-
                        config.yaml: "grade", "show_log", "acescg2srgb",
                        "logc2srgb", "logc2acescg"
  -d, --debug           Set debug to true.


	# Example commands

	## Daily using the "avchd" codec defined in the yaml configuration file. Output to the "movie_location" path specified in the config.
	daily /drive/video/20181108/exr/M02-0014/M02-0014_%06d.exr -c avchq

	## Daily the same exr sequence to a test output directory, using the "hevc_1440p" codec, and a "log" ocio color transform defined in the "ocio_profiles" section of the config.
	daily /drive/video/20181108/exr/ -o ~/tmp/test_output -c hevc_1440p --ocio /path/to/ocio/config.ocio -ct log
```

## Dependencies
- [OpenImageIO](https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio) - Python module used for all image and color manipulations. Must be compiled with OpenImageIO support. Must be OpenImageIO >= 2.0
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) - Used for encoding from OpenImageIO to quicktime.
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Optional Python module used for photo jpeg output. Jpegs are encoded using OpenimageIO -> Pillow -> ffmpeg.
- [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org) - Python module used for OpenImageIO pixel data manipulations.
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML) to read config files - pip install PyYAML
- [timecode](https://pypi.org/project/timecode/) to manage timecode and frames - pip install timecode
- [pyseq](https://pypi.org/project/pyseq/) to parse image sequences - pip install pyseq

Install on Debian was a bit of a pain. The python3-openimageio apt package is only available in Debian bullseye, and also only works with python3.9 which is not the default. I installed the above modules as follows:
- python3.9 -m pip install timecode pyseq

## Logic
- Dailies profiles defined in the config file specify how to handle the image
- The text-elements items in the profile define the expected text overlay and their layout
